- Use TDD principles for all development. Write tests first, then implement the minimal code to pass the tests. Refactor after passing the tests.
- keep commit message short and concise, imperative mood - for example "add user authentication" not "added user authentication"
- restart server after changes pass verification tests
- use browser subagent to verify changes after tests pass
