- **For every feature/change, follow the `/feature-implementation` workflow** (`.agent/workflows/feature-implementation.md`). A feature is NOT done until all 3 layers pass: (1) Unit Tests (Red→Green→Refactor), (2) CLI/Integration (`pre-commit.sh` + `verify_restart.sh`), (3) Browser subagent verification.
- Write small, single-purpose functions by default (SRP, clean code)
- Use TDD principles for all development. Write tests first, then implement the minimal code to pass the tests. Refactor after passing the tests.
- keep commit message short and concise, imperative mood - for example "add user authentication" not "added user authentication"
- restart server after changes pass verification tests
- always use browser subagent to verify changes after tests pass
- make sure to update spec.md after changes and tests pass, critique codebase in relation to goal in spec.md
- NEVER lower test coverage threshold to allow a commit, if coverage is low, write more tests
